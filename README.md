# AI Discord Chat and Talk Bot

This is an AI-powered Discord bot that can chat and talk with users in a Discord server. It utilizes natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user messages.

## Features

- Chatting: The bot can engage in conversations with users, providing intelligent and context-aware responses.
- Voice Interaction: The bot can also speak  to users using text-to-speech and speech recognition technologies. The bot can not listen because Discord's API does not give access to this.
- Customization: The bot can be customized with additional functionalities and integrations to suit specific needs.

## Details
- This bot can use either OpenAI's ChatGPT or Mistral's generative chat bot
- For the text-to-speech the bot can use either GoogleTTS or ElevenLabs. ElevenLabs in my opinion sounds better but it is more expensive to use.
